4814
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679



4815
01:13:15.679 --> 01:13:16.070

4829
01:13:25.199 --> 01:13:27.189
>> Yeah. Many years ago.

4841
01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:35.110

4855
01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.550

4875
01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.310
Like, is it like

4877
01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.070

4879
01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.430

4880
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440



4881
01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:12.070

4885
01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:16.070
>> And then sometimes you can get stumped.

4886
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080



4887
01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.070

04:00:17.830 --> 04:00:17.840



15675
04:00:17.840 --> 04:00:18.389
>> Damn it.

15676
04:00:18.389 --> 04:00:18.399



15677
04:00:18.399 --> 04:00:19.269
>> Thank you, gentlemen.

15678
04:00:19.269 --> 04:00:19.279



15679
04:00:19.279 --> 04:00:20.550
>> What do you think went into

15680
04:00:20.550 --> 04:00:20.560



15681
04:00:20.560 --> 04:00:21.830
accomplishing that?

15682
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840



15683
04:00:21.840 --> 04:00:23.110
>> Like what all had to happen

15684
04:00:23.110 --> 04:00:23.120



15685
04:00:23.120 --> 04:00:24.790
>> today? I mean, dude, all I'm going to be

15686
04:00:24.790 --> 04:00:24.800



15687
04:00:24.800 --> 04:00:26.710
thinking about is that cornhole for the

15688
04:00:26.710 --> 04:00:26.720



15689
04:00:26.720 --> 04:00:27.349
next

15690
04:00:27.349 --> 04:00:27.359



15691
04:00:27.359 --> 04:00:30.070
>> It tripped up from Yeah. What had to

15692
04:00:30.070 --> 04:00:30.080



15693
04:00:30.080 --> 04:00:30.790
fall into place?

15694
04:00:30.790 --> 04:00:30.800



15695
04:00:30.800 --> 04:00:31.830
>> That cornhole. The cornhole

15696
04:00:31.830 --> 04:00:31.840



15697
04:00:31.840 --> 04:00:34.070
>> in order for you to beat like Jared from

15698
04:00:34.070 --> 04:00:34.080



15699
04:00:34.080 --> 04:00:35.110
Subway.

15700
04:00:35.110 --> 04:00:35.120



15701
04:00:35.120 --> 04:00:37.269
>> I would have needed Oh, today.

15702
04:00:37.269 --> 04:00:37.279



15703
04:00:37.279 --> 04:00:38.630
>> Yeah. I mean, I don't know, dude. You

15704
04:00:38.630 --> 04:00:38.640



15705
04:00:38.640 --> 04:00:39.990
know, just stuck with it. Didn't let the

15706
04:00:39.990 --> 04:00:40.000



15707
04:00:40.000 --> 04:00:41.750
legacy of the first bad step hold me

15708
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760



15709
04:00:41.760 --> 04:00:43.269
down. Trust the process. Stay in the

15710
04:00:43.269 --> 04:00:43.279



15711
04:00:43.279 --> 04:00:44.870
>> To even have that opportunity. What

15712
04:00:44.870 --> 04:00:44.880



15713
04:00:44.880 --> 04:00:46.630
would have to have had happened?

15714
04:00:46.630 --> 04:00:46.640



15715
04:00:46.640 --> 04:00:49.110
>> Cuz Jared did it in his big fat jeans.

15716
04:00:49.110 --> 04:00:49.120



15717
04:00:49.120 --> 04:00:51.349
>> Oh, are you Wait,

15718
04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359



15719
04:00:51.359 --> 04:00:52.389
>> there's something I'm missing here,

15720
04:00:52.389 --> 04:00:52.399



15721
04:00:52.399 --> 04:00:53.349
isn't there?

15722
04:00:53.349 --> 04:00:53.359



15723
04:00:53.359 --> 04:00:54.550
>> Oh,

15724
04:00:54.550 --> 04:00:54.560



15725
04:00:54.560 --> 04:00:56.389
>> no. No, not at all. Unfortunately,

15726
04:00:56.389 --> 04:00:56.399



15727
04:00:56.399 --> 04:00:57.830
>> he didn't actually. We just been trying

15728
04:00:57.830 --> 04:00:57.840



15729
04:00:57.840 --> 04:00:58.630
to get a reaction.

15730
04:00:58.630 --> 04:00:58.640



15731
04:00:58.640 --> 04:01:00.229
>> Oh, that Jared from Subway actually did

15732
04:01:00.229 --> 04:01:00.239



15733
04:01:00.239 --> 04:01:00.630
it.

15734
04:01:00.630 --> 04:01:00.640



15735
04:01:00.640 --> 04:01:01.429
>> Yeah, we've been trying to get a

15736
04:01:01.429 --> 04:01:01.439



15737
04:01:01.439 --> 04:01:03.110
reaction for about 6 months and no one's

15738
04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:03.120



15739
04:01:03.120 --> 04:01:04.870
giving us a reaction. So, it's the worst

15740
04:01:04.870 --> 04:01:04.880



15741
04:01:04.880 --> 04:01:06.710
bit we're doing. Someday it's going to

15742
04:01:06.710 --> 04:01:06.720



15743
04:01:06.720 --> 04:01:08.630
happen. I figured there's a chance he

15744
04:01:08.630 --> 04:01:08.640



15745
04:01:08.640 --> 04:01:09.750
did it.

15746
04:01:09.750 --> 04:01:09.760



15747
04:01:09.760 --> 04:01:10.229
>> Yeah,

15748
04:01:10.229 --> 04:01:10.239



15749
04:01:10.239 --> 04:01:11.590
>> that's the problem. There is a chance he

15750
04:01:11.590 --> 04:01:11.600



15751
04:01:11.600 --> 04:01:12.550
did it, guys.

15752
04:01:12.550 --> 04:01:12.560



15753
04:01:12.560 --> 04:01:13.510
>> Too confusing.

15754
04:01:13.510 --> 04:01:13.520



15755
04:01:13.520 --> 04:01:14.229
>> I figured he did.

15756
04:01:14.229 --> 04:01:14.239



15757
04:01:14.239 --> 04:01:14.950
>> That's why it's

15758
04:01:14.950 --> 04:01:14.960



15759
04:01:14.960 --> 04:01:16.229
>> How is there a chance?

15760
04:01:16.229 --> 04:01:16.239



15761
04:01:16.239 --> 04:01:17.990
>> There's

15762
04:01:17.990 --> 04:01:18.000



15763
04:01:18.000 --> 04:01:19.750
people timelines get mixed up.

15764
04:01:19.750 --> 04:01:19.760



15765
04:01:19.760 --> 04:01:20.630
>> Well, people don't know how long the

15766

15767
04:01:20.640 --> 04:01:22.150

15769
04:01:22.160 --> 04:01:23.590

15770
04:01:23.590 --> 04:01:23.600



15771
04:01:23.600 --> 04:01:23.750
it.

15772
04:01:23.750 --> 04:01:23.760



15773
04:01:23.760 --> 04:01:23.990
>> Yeah.

15774

15775
04:01:24.000 --> 04:01:25.269
>> The fact that we don't get a reaction is

15776
04:01:25.269 --> 04:01:25.279



15777
04:01:25.279 --> 04:01:26.630
why we have to keep doing it. If we got

15778
04:01:26.630 --> 04:01:26.640



15779
04:01:26.640 --> 04:01:28.550

15780
04:01:28.550 --> 04:01:28.560



15781
04:01:28.560 --> 04:01:30.070

15783
04:01:30.080 --> 04:01:31.269
worthwhile pursuit.

04:01:31.269 --> 04:01:31.279



15785
04:01:31.279 --> 04:01:33.030

15923
04:03:22.080 --> 04:03:23.750
in one day. Jared Subway did it only

15933
04:03:30.239 --> 04:03:32.070
can get a reaction out of people and it

15934
04:03:32.070 --> 04:03:32.080



15935
04:03:32.080 --> 04:03:33.429
